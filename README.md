# Bookstore Application

During practical project we need to build some sort of bookstore app.

### Sample functionality:

- Menu
- Add/Remove Book
- Get Book Information
- Find Books
- Books
- Author information (optional)

### How to build it?

- Need to create tasks for each person (trello, drive - excel)
- Shared access to single git repository (github)
- Data structure: Book(isbn, title, description, author, pages, publishing year, publisher)
